# Movie_Recommendation_System
A Python-based Program that recommends movies based on Emotion

# Basics Used:
- Data Mining ( Scraping )

# Recommendation:
- Based on the emotion entered, each emotion has been quantified as follows:

- Sad – Drama
- Disgust – Musical
- Anger – Family
- Anticipation – Thriller
- Fear – Sport
- Enjoyment – Thriller
- Trust – Western
- Surprise – Film-Noir

# Scraping:
- IMDb does not have an API , so data accumulation is performed by using scraping a particular URL of the encountering emotion.
- Based on the emotion entered, top 'n' movies for that emotion are displayed, where 'n' is entered by the user.
